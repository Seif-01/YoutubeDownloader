How to use YouTube Downloader - explained step by step!

## Basic Download

### 1. Get a Video URL

Go to YouTube and copy the URL of any video. The URL looks like:
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

You can also use the short URLs:
```
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

### 2. Paste URL in the App

Click in the URL input box and paste (Ctrl+V) the URL.

### 3. Choose Quality

Click the quality dropdown menu and select your preferred format:

**Video Formats:**
- 360p - Small file, lower quality (good for old phones)
- 480p - SD quality (YouTube standard)
- 720p - HD quality (most common)
- 1080p - Full HD (recommended for most uses)
- 1440p - 2K quality (if available)
- 2160p - 4K quality (huge files!)

**Audio Only:**
- MP3 - Universal audio format
- M4A - Better quality, smaller file

**Tips:**
- Higher quality = bigger file size
- Not all videos have all qualities
- Audio-only is great for music videos

### 4. Choose Download Location

Click the "Browse" button to select where to save the file.

Default location: `C:\Users\YourName\Downloads`

### 5. Start Download

Click the big **Download** button!

You'll see:
- Progress bar filling up
- Download speed (MB/s)
- File size downloaded / total size
- Estimated time remaining

### 6. Wait for Completion

When done, you'll see a "Completed" message. The file is saved in your chosen location!

## Advanced Features

### Queue Multiple Downloads

You can download multiple videos at the same time:

1. Paste first URL and click Download
2. Paste second URL and click Download again
3. Both will download simultaneously!

Each download gets its own progress bar in the downloads list.

### Custom Filename

The app automatically names files using the video title. Invalid characters are replaced with underscores.

If a file already exists, it adds a number: `Video Title (1).mp4`

### Pause and Resume

> **Note:** This feature is planned but not implemented yet!

In the future you'll be able to pause downloads and resume them later.

### Clear Completed Downloads

Click the **Clear Completed** button to remove finished downloads from the list.

## Tips and Tricks

### Fastest Downloads

- Use a wired internet connection (faster than WiFi)
- Close other apps using bandwidth
- Download during off-peak hours

### Save Space

- Choose 720p instead of 1080p (often looks the same on smaller screens)
- Use MP3 for music (audio-only is much smaller than video)
- Delete videos after watching if you don't need to keep them

### Best Quality

- Choose 1080p for most videos
- For music videos, use M4A (better than MP3)
- 4K is only worth it if you have a 4K monitor

### Avoid Errors

- Copy the full YouTube URL (including https://)
- Don't use playlist URLs (not supported yet)
- Make sure the video is public (not private or deleted)
- Check your internet connection
